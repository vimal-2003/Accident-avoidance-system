# Accident Avoidance System

## Overview

The Accident Avoidance System is designed to mitigate road accidents by detecting signs of driver drowsiness using an infrared (IR) sensor. Unlike traditional systems that rely on cameras, our approach offers a non-intrusive alternative with high accuracy.

This system, powered by an Arduino Uno microcontroller, continuously monitors the driver's eye blinks. Upon detecting patterns indicative of drowsiness, it triggers alerts to prompt the driver's attention, potentially preventing accidents.
